I am an MPhil student in [the Hong Kong university of science and technology](https://hkust.edu.hk/) majoring in computer science and engineering. I am fortunate enough to work with [Prof. CHAN Shueng Han, Gary](https://www.cse.ust.hk/~gchan/) in the area of video analysis. I graduated from HKUST in 2022 as a bachelor of science in computer science.
