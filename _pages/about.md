I am an Ph.D. student in [the Hong Kong University of Science and Technology](https://hkust.edu.hk/) majoring in Computer Science and Engineering. I am fortunate enough to work with [Prof. CHAN Shueng Han, Gary](https://www.cse.ust.hk/~gchan/) in the area of 3D human sensing and video understanding. I earned my M.Phil. in Computer Science and Engineering from HKUST in 2024, after completing my B.Sc. in Computer Science at the same institution in 2022.
